Q2
A customer is deploying an SSL enabled web application to AWS and would like to implement a separation of roles between
the EC2 service administrators that are entitled to login to instances as well as making API calls and the security
officers who will maintain and have exclusive access to the application's X.509 certificate that contains the private
key.

A. Upload the certificate on an S3 bucket owned by the security officers and accessible only by EC2 Role of the web
servers.<br>
B. Configure the web servers to retrieve the certificate upon boot from an CloudHSM is managed by the security
officers.<br>
C. Configure system permissions on the web servers to restrict access to the certificate only to the authority security
officers<br>
D. Configure IAM policies authorizing access to the certificate store only to the security officers and terminate SSL on
an ELB.<br>

정답 : D
Client -> ELB 까지만 SSL을 유지하고 ELB -> EC2로는 SSL을 적용하지않는다. 그리고 certificate store에 접근할 수 있는 권한을 IAM으로 컨트롤한다.
이렇게함으로써 EC2관리자는 SSL에 대해서 몰라도 앞단에서 보안을 유지해준다.

Q3
You have recently joined a startup company building sensors to measure street noise and air quality in urban areas. The
company has been running a pilot deployment of around 100 sensors for 3 months each sensor uploads 1KB of sensor data
every minute to a backend hosted on AWS.
During the pilot, you measured a peak or 10 IOPS on the database, and you stored an average of 3GB of sensor data per
month in the database.
The current deployment consists of a load-balanced auto scaled Ingestion layer using EC2 instances and a PostgreSQL RDS
database with 500GB standard storage.
The pilot is considered a success and your CEO has managed to get the attention or some potential investors. The
business plan requires a deployment of at least 100K sensors which needs to be supported by the backend. You also need
to store sensor data for at least two years to be able to compare year over year
Improvements.
To secure funding, you have to make sure that the platform meets these requirements and leaves room for further scaling.
Which setup win meet the requirements?

A. Add an SQS queue to the ingestion layer to buffer writes to the RDS instance<br>
B. Ingest data into a DynamoDB table and move old data to a Redshift cluster<br>
C. Replace the RDS instance with a 6 node Redshift cluster with 96TB of storage<br>
D. Keep the current architecture but upgrade RDS storage to 3TB and 10K provisioned IOPS<br>

대부분 C가 96TB가 넘어간다는데 3GB * 1000 * 12 * 2 = 72TB로 계산되는데 왜 넘어간다는지 모르겠다..
B, C로 답변이 갈리는 상황이고 GPT는 B를 선택

```
B. DynamoDB로 데이터를 수집하고 오래된 데이터를 Redshift로 이동: DynamoDB는 높은 처리량과 확장성을 제공하는 NoSQL 데이터베이스 서비스이며, Redshift는 대량의 데이터 웨어하우징을 위한 서비스입니다. 이 방법은 데이터 수집 및 장기적인 저장에 적합할 수 있으며, 데이터 분석과 보고에도 유용합니다.

C. RDS 인스턴스를 6노드 96TB 저장 용량의 Redshift 클러스터로 교체: 이 옵션은 현재 RDS 기반의 아키텍처를 대규모 데이터 웨어하우징 솔루션인 Redshift로 전환하는 것을 제안합니다. 이는 대규모 센서 데이터를 효율적으로 처리하고 저장할 수 있는 강력한 해결책이 될 수 있습니다.

Q7
You've been hired to enhance the overall security posture for a very large e-commerce site. They have a well architected
multi-tier application running in a VPC that uses ELBs in front of both the web and the app tier with static assets
served directly from S3. They are using a combination of RDS and DynamoDB for their dynamic data and then archiving
nightly into S3 for further processing with EMR. They are concerned because they found questionable log entries and
suspect someone is attempting to gain unauthorized access.
Which approach provides a cost effective scalable mitigation to this kind of attack?

A. Recommend that they lease space at a DirectConnect partner location and establish a 1G DirectConnect connection to
their VPC they would then establish Internet connectivity into their space, filter the traffic in hardware Web
Application Firewall (WAF). And then pass the traffic through the DirectConnect connection into their application
running in their VPC.<br>
B. Add previously identified hostile source IPs as an explicit INBOUND DENY NACL to the web tier subnet.<br>
C. Add a WAF tier by creating a new ELB and an AutoScaling group of EC2 Instances running a host-based WAF. They would
redirect Route 53 to resolve to the new WAF tier ELB. The WAF tier would their pass the traffic to the current web tier
The web tier Security Groups would be updated to only allow traffic from the WAF tier Security Group<br>
D. Remove all but TLS 1.2 from the web tier ELB and enable Advanced Protocol Filtering. This will enable the ELB itself
to perform WAF functionality.<br>

Q13
Your application is using an ELB in front of an Auto Scaling group of web/application servers deployed across two AZs
and a Multi-AZ RDS Instance for data persistence.
The database CPU is often above 80% usage and 90% of I/O operations on the database are reads. To improve performance
you recently added a single-node
Memcached ElastiCache Cluster to cache frequent DB query results. In the next weeks the overall workload is expected to
grow by 30%.
Do you need to change anything in the architecture to maintain the high availability or the application with the
anticipated additional load? Why?

A. Yes, you should deploy two Memcached ElastiCache Clusters in different AZs because the RDS instance will not be able
to handle the load if the cache node fails.<br>
B. No, if the cache node fails you can always get the same data from the DB without having any availability impact.<br>
C. No, if the cache node fails the automated ElastiCache node recovery feature will prevent any availability impact.<br>
D. Yes, you should deploy the Memcached ElastiCache Cluster with two nodes in the same AZ as the RDS DB master instance
to handle the load if one cache node fails.<br>

정답 : A

정답 : B

아래는 지피티의 답변입니다.

아래처럼 s3에 모든 권한이 부여됐는데 버킷을 볼 수가없어?
"Action":["s3:*"],

ChatGPT
IAM 정책에서 "Action":["s3:*"]로 설정되어 있다면 이론적으로는 모든 S3 관련 작업에 대한 권한이 부여된 것처럼 보입니다. 그러나 AWS S3 콘솔을 통해 버킷을 볼 때, 단순히 특정 작업에 대한
권한을 부여하는 것만으로는 충분하지 않습니다.

AWS S3 콘솔을 사용하여 버킷을 탐색하려면 사용자는 두 가지 특별한 권한이 필요합니다. 첫 번째는 'ListAllMyBuckets' 작업입니다. 이 작업은 사용자가 AWS 계정의 모든 버킷 목록을 볼 수 있게
해줍니다. 두 번째는 'GetBucketLocation' 작업입니다. 이 작업은 사용자가 S3 콘솔에 처음 접속할 때 버킷의 위치 정보를 가져오는 데 필요합니다.

따라서, 비록 "s3:*"로 모든 S3 작업에 대한 권한이 부여되었다고 해도, 이 두 가지 특별한 작업에 대한 권한이 명시적으로 포함되어 있지 않다면 사용자는 S3 콘솔을 통해 버킷을 볼 수 없습니다. 이것이 해당
IAM 정책이 S3 콘솔을 사용하여 버킷을 볼 수 있도록 충분하지 않은 이유입니다.

Q23
You have launched an EC2 instance with four (4) 500 GB EBS Provisioned IOPS volumes attached. The EC2 instance is
EBS-Optimized and supports 500 Mbps throughput between EC2 and EBS. The four EBS volumes are configured as a single RAID
0 device, and each Provisioned IOPS volume is provisioned with 4,000
IOPS (4,000 16KB reads or writes), for a total of 16,000 random IOPS on the instance. The EC2 instance initially
delivers the expected 16,000 IOPS random read and write performance. Sometime later, in order to increase the total
random I/O performance of the instance, you add an additional two 500 GB EBS Provisioned
IOPS volumes to the RAID. Each volume is provisioned to 4,000 IOPs like the original four, for a total of 24,000 IOPS on
the EC2 instance. Monitoring shows that the EC2 instance CPU utilization increased from 50% to 70%, but the total random
IOPS measured at the instance level does not increase at all.
What is the problem and a valid solution?

A. The EBS-Optimized throughput limits the total IOPS that can be utilized; use an EBSOptimized instance that provides
larger throughput.<br>
B. Small block sizes cause performance degradation, limiting the I/O throughput; configure the instance device driver
and filesystem to use 64KB blocks to increase throughput.<br>
C. The standard EBS Instance root volume limits the total IOPS rate; change the instance root volume to also be a 500GB
4,000 Provisioned IOPS volume.<br>
D. Larger storage volumes support higher Provisioned IOPS rates; increase the provisioned volume storage of each of the
6 EBS volumes to 1TB.<br>
E. RAID 0 only scales linearly to about 4 devices; use RAID 0 with 4 EBS Provisioned IOPS volumes, but increase each
Provisioned IOPS EBS volume to 6,000 IOPS.<br>

Q30
To serve Web traffic for a popular product your chief financial officer and IT director have purchased 10 m1.large heavy
utilization Reserved Instances (RIs), evenly spread across two availability zones; Route 53 is used to deliver the
traffic to an Elastic Load Balancer (ELB). After several months, the product grows even more popular and you need
additional capacity. As a result, your company purchases two C3.2xlarge medium utilization Ris. You register the two
c3.2xlarge instances with your ELB and quickly find that the m1.large instances are at 100% of capacity and the
c3.2xlarge instances have significant capacity that's unused.
Which option is the most cost effective and uses EC2 capacity most effectively?

A. Configure Autoscaling group and Launch Configuration with ELB to add up to 10 more on-demand m1.large instances when
triggered by Cloudwatch. Shut off c3.2xlarge instances.<br>
B. Configure ELB with two c3.2xlarge instances and use on-demand Autoscaling group for up to two additional c3.2xlarge
instances. Shut off m1.large instances.<br>
C. Route traffic to EC2 m1.large and c3.2xlarge instances directly using Route 53 latency based routing and health
checks. Shut off ELB.<br>
D. Use a separate ELB for each instance type and distribute load to ELBs with Route 53 weighted round robin.<br>

정답 : D

Q31
You have deployed a web application targeting a global audience across multiple AWS Regions under the domain
name.example.com. You decide to use
Route53 Latency-Based Routing to serve web requests to users from the region closest to the user. To provide business
continuity in the event of server downtime you configure weighted record sets associated with two web servers in
separate Availability Zones per region. Dunning a DR test you notice that when you disable all web servers in one of the
regions Route53 does not automatically direct all users to the other region.
What could be happening? (Choose two.)

A. Latency resource record sets cannot be used in combination with weighted resource record sets.<br>
B. You did not setup an HTTP health check to one or more of the weighted resource record sets associated with me
disabled web servers.<br>
C. The value of the weight associated with the latency alias resource record set in the region with the disabled servers
is higher than the weight for the other region.<br>
D. One of the two working web servers in the other region did not pass its HTTP health check.<br>
E. You did not set "Evaluate Target Health" to "Yes" on the latency alias resource record set associated with example
com in the region where you disabled the servers.<br>

정답 : B, E

Route53을 통해서 레코드에 따른 health check가 가능합니다. AWS Route 53의 지연 시간 기반 라우팅(Latency-Based Routing)을 사용하면, 사용자가 가장 가까운 리전의 서버에 자동으로 연결되도록 할 수 있습니다.

만약 해당 리전의 모든 서버(A 레코드)가 다운되었다면, Route 53은 다른 리전으로 요청을 자동으로 라우팅합니다.

이를 위해서는 각 리전의 서버 상태를 모니터링하는 HTTP 헬스 체크와 "Evaluate Target Health" 설정을 올바르게 구성해야 합니다. 

헬스 체크가 활성화되어 있고 "Evaluate Target Health"가 "Yes"로 설정되어 있다면, Route 53은 비정상적인 서버를 감지하고, 사용자 요청을 건강한 서버가 위치한 다른 리전으로 자동으로 라우팅합니다.

정답 : C

AWS의 Simple Workflow Service (SWF)는 개발자들이 분산된 애플리케이션, 프로세스, 또는 워크플로우를 쉽게 구축하고 실행할 수 있게 해주는 서비스입니다. SWF의 주요 역할과 기능은 다음과
같습니다:

워크플로우 관리: SWF는 복잡한 워크플로우의 조정과 실행을 관리합니다. 예를 들어, 여러 단계의 작업 처리 순서를 정의하고, 각 단계가 성공적으로 완료되었는지 추적할 수 있습니다.

태스크 분배: SWF는 다양한 태스크(작업)를 적절한 작업자(소프트웨어 프로그램 또는 프로세스)에게 할당합니다. 이는 워크플로우 내에서 특정 작업이 어느 시점에 실행되어야 하는지 결정하는 데 도움이 됩니다.

상태 유지 및 조정: SWF는 워크플로우의 상태를 유지하며, 각 태스크의 진행 상황을 추적합니다. 이를 통해 어느 단계가 완료되었는지, 어떤 작업이 다음으로 수행되어야 하는지 파악할 수 있습니다.

신뢰성과 일관성: SWF는 작업의 중복 실행을 방지하고, 워크플로우의 일관성을 유지하는 데 도움을 줍니다. 이는 오류가 발생했을 때 안정적인 복구 및 재실행을 가능하게 합니다.

확장성: SWF는 확장성이 뛰어나며, 수많은 작업과 복잡한 워크플로우를 효율적으로 관리할 수 있습니다.

통합 및 호환성: 다른 AWS 서비스와의 통합이 용이하여, 예를 들어 Amazon EC2, Amazon RDS, Amazon S3 등과 함께 사용할 수 있습니다.

Q54
You are implementing a URL whitelisting system for a company that wants to restrict outbound HTTP'S connections to
specific domains from their EC2-hosted applications. You deploy a single EC2 instance running proxy software and
configure It to accept traffic from all subnets and EC2 instances in the VPC. You configure the proxy to only pass
through traffic to domains that you define in its whitelist configuration. You have a nightly maintenance window or 10
minutes where all instances fetch new software updates. Each update Is about 200MB In size and there are 500 instances
In the VPC that routinely fetch updates. After a few days you notice that some machines are failing to successfully
download some, but not all of their updates within the maintenance window. The download
URLs used for these updates are correctly listed in the proxy's whitelist configuration and you are able to access them
manually using a web browser on the instances.
What might be happening? (Choose two.)

A. You are running the proxy on an undersized EC2 instance type so network throughput is not sufficient for all
instances to download their updates in time.<br>
B. You are running the proxy on a sufficiently-sized EC2 instance in a private subnet and its network throughput is
being throttled by a NAT running on an undersized EC2 instance.<br>
C. The route table for the subnets containing the affected EC2 instances is not configured to direct network traffic for
the software update locations to the proxy.<br>
D. You have not allocated enough storage to the EC2 instance running the proxy so the network buffer is filling up,
causing some requests to fail.<br>

Q69
Your company hosts a social media website for storing and sharing documents. The web application allows user to upload
large files while resuming and pausing the upload as needed. Currently, files are uploaded to your PHP front end backed
by Elastic Load Balancing and an autoscaling fleet of Amazon Elastic Compute
Cloud (EC2) instances that scale upon average of bytes received (NetworkIn). After a file has been uploaded, it is
copied to Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3).
Amazon EC2 instances use an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that allows Amazon S3 uploads. Over the last
six months, your user base and scale have increased significantly, forcing you to increase the Auto Scaling group's Max
parameter a few times. Your CFO is concerned about rising costs and has asked you to adjust the architecture where
needed to better optimize costs.
Which architecture change could you introduce to reduce costs and still keep your web application secure and scalable?

A. Replace the Auto Scaling launch configuration to include c3.8xlarge instances; those instances can potentially yield
a network throuthput of 10gbps.<br>
B. Re-architect your ingest pattern, have the app authenticate against your identity provider, and use your identity
provider as a broker fetching temporary AWS credentials from AWS Secure Token Service (GetFederationToken). Securely
pass the credentials and S3 endpoint/prefix to your app. Implement client-side logic to directly upload the file to
Amazon S3 using the given credentials and S3 prefix.<br>
C. Re-architect your ingest pattern, and move your web application instances into a VPC public subnet. Attach a public
IP address for each EC2 instance (using the Auto Scaling launch configuration settings). Use Amazon Route 53 Round Robin
records set and HTTP health check to DNS load balance the app requests; this approach will significantly reduce the cost
by bypassing Elastic Load Balancing.<br>
D. Re-architect your ingest pattern, have the app authenticate against your identity provider, and use your identity
provider as a broker fetching temporary AWS credentials from AWS Secure Token Service (GetFederationToken). Securely
pass the credentials and S3 endpoint/prefix to your app. Implement client-side logic that used the S3 multipart upload
API to directly upload the file to Amazon S3 using the given credentials and S3 prefix.<br>

정답 : D

B라고 생각했는데 D가 정답이다. S3에 멀티파트 업로드 API라는 기능이 있다. 이것을 사용하는게 포인트였다. 아래는 지피티의 답변이다.

Amazon S3(Simple Storage Service)에는 멀티파트 업로드라는 기능이 있습니다. 이 기능은 큰 파일을 여러 부분으로 나누어 업로드하는 데 사용되며, 특히 대용량 파일을 효율적으로 업로드하거나
네트워크 연결이 불안정할 때 매우 유용합니다. 멀티파트 업로드의 주요 특징은 다음과 같습니다:

대용량 파일 업로드: 멀티파트 업로드는 큰 파일을 여러 개의 작은 부분으로 나누어 업로드할 수 있게 해줍니다. 이는 특히 수 GB 이상의 큰 파일을 업로드할 때 유용합니다.

업로드 중단 및 재개: 파일의 각 부분은 독립적으로 업로드됩니다. 따라서 업로드 중에 네트워크 문제가 발생하더라도 이미 업로드된 부분은 다시 업로드할 필요가 없으며, 업로드를 중단한 후 나중에 재개할 수 있습니다.

효율적인 전송: 각 부분을 병렬로 업로드할 수 있어 전체 업로드 시간을 단축할 수 있습니다.

오류 복구: 만약 업로드 중 한 부분이 실패하더라도, 전체 파일을 처음부터 다시 업로드할 필요 없이 실패한 부분만 다시 업로드할 수 있습니다.

servers, two application servers, two database servers and one NAT instance tor a total of seven EC2 instances. The web,
application and database servers are deployed across two availability zones
(AZs). You also deploy an ELB in front of the two web servers, and use Route53 for DNS Web (raffle gradually increases
in the first few days following the deployment, so you attempt to double the number of instances in each tier of the
application to handle the new load unfortunately some of these new instances fail to launch.
Which of the following could be the root caused? (Choose two.)

A. AWS reserves the first and the last private IP address in each subnet's CIDR block so you do not have enough
addresses left to launch all of the new EC2 instances<br>
B. The Internet Gateway (IGW) of your VPC has scaled-up, adding more instances to handle the traffic spike, reducing the
number of available private IP addresses for new instance launches<br>
C. The ELB has scaled-up, adding more instances to handle the traffic spike, reducing the number of available private IP
addresses for new instance launches<br>
D. AWS reserves one IP address in each subnet's CIDR block for Route53 so you do not have enough addresses left to
launch all of the new EC2 instances<br>
E. AWS reserves the first four and the last IP address in each subnet's CIDR block so you do not have enough addresses
left to launch all of the new EC2 instances<br>

Q74 You are migrating a legacy client-server application to AWS. The application responds to a specific DNS domain (
e.g. www.example.com) and has a 2-tier architecture, with multiple application servers and a database server. Remote
clients use TCP to connect to the application servers. The application servers need to know the IP address of the
clients in order to function properly and are currently taking that information from the TCP socket. A Multi-AZ RDS
MySQL instance will be used for the database.
During the migration you can change the application code, but you have to file a change request.
How would you implement the architecture on AWS in order to maximize scalability and high availability?

A. File a change request to implement Alias Resource support in the application. Use Route 53 Alias Resource Record to
distribute load on two application servers in different Azs.<br>
B. File a change request to implement Latency Based Routing support in the application. Use Route 53 with Latency Based
Routing enabled to distribute load on two application servers in different Azs.<br>
C. File a change request to implement Cross-Zone support in the application. Use an ELB with a TCP Listener and
Cross-Zone Load Balancing enabled, two application servers in different AZs.<br>
D. File a change request to implement Proxy Protocol support in the application. Use an ELB with a TCP Listener and
Proxy Protocol enabled to distribute load on two application servers in different Azs.<br>

정답 : C

ALB에서 TCP 리스너로 보내려면 Proxy Protocol를 사용해야만이 IP주소를 보낼 수 있다. 하지만 NLB는 IP주소를 별다른 설정없이 보낼 수 있다.
그래서 NLB를 사용하면서 Cross-Zone을 사용하는게 최적이다.

Q78
An ecommerce company wants to redirect users to a country-specific website when they enter the example.com website. For
example, the company wants to redirect United States users to example.com/us/ and wants to redirect French users to
example.com/fr/. The web application is using Amazon CloudFront and an
Application Load Balancer with an Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) cluster. The application's domain name
resolution is configured in an
Amazon Route 53 public hosted zone.
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational effort?

A. Update the routing policy for the application's Route 53 record to specify geolocation routing. Configure listener
rules based on a unique alias location to redirect requests to the correct URLs by country.<br>
B. Create a CloudFront function to inspect the CloudFront-Viewer-Country header and return redirect responses to
different URLs based on user location.<br>
C. On the ECS web server configuration, use a GeoIP database to look up the requested IP address and redirect requests
to the correct URLs by country.<br>
D. Use AWS WAF to determine the country of origin. Create an AWS WAF custom rule with a geographic match condition to
redirect traffic from each country to the correct URL.<br>

정답 : B
A를 골랐었지만 route53은 도메인의 값만 변경할 수 있다고 한다. 반면에 클라우드 프론트는 사용자의 위치에 따라 적절한 path로 리다이랙트가 가능하다고한다.

아래는 지피티의 대답이다.

Amazon CloudFront는 주로 콘텐츠 전송 네트워크(CDN)로 사용되며, 사용자에게 빠르게 정적 파일을 제공하는 것이 주 목적입니다. 그러나 CloudFront는 단순히 정적 콘텐츠 전송을 넘어서 동적
콘텐츠 처리 및 사용자 요청에 따른 리디렉션을 지원하는 기능도 제공합니다.

CloudFront의 동적 콘텐츠 처리 기능을 사용하면, 사용자의 위치, 디바이스 유형, 쿠키 등의 요청 특성에 따라 콘텐츠를 사용자 정의할 수 있습니다. 또한, CloudFront 함수를 사용하여 사용자 요청의
특정 헤더(예: CloudFront-Viewer-Country)를 분석하고 이를 기반으로 국가별 URL로 리디렉션하는 것도 가능합니다.

이 경우, CloudFront 함수는 사용자의 위치 정보를 확인하고, 이를 기반으로 국가별로 적절한 웹사이트로 동적으로 리디렉션하는 역할을 합니다. 이는 CloudFront가 단순히 정적 콘텐츠를 전송하는 것을
넘어서, 사용자의 요청에 기반하여 동적으로 처리하는 기능을 제공한다는 것을 의미합니다.

Q89
You need a persistent and durable storage to trace call activity of an IVR (Interactive Voice Response) system. Call duration is mostly in the 2-3 minutes timeframe. Each traced call can be either active or terminated. An external application needs to know each minute the list of currently active calls. Usually there are a few calls/second, but once per month there is a periodic peak up to 1000 calls/second for a few hours. The system is open 24/7 and any downtime should be avoided. Historical data is periodically archived to files. Cost saving is a priority for this project.
What database implementation would better fit this scenario, keeping costs as low as possible?

A. Use DynamoDB with a "Calls" table and a Global Secondary Index on a "State" attribute that can equal to "active" or "terminated". In this way the Global Secondary Index can be used for all items in the table.<br>
B. Use RDS Multi-AZ with a "CALLS" table and an indexed "STATE" field that can be equal to "ACTIVE" or 'TERMINATED". In this way the SQL query is optimized by the use of the Index.<br>
C. Use RDS Multi-AZ with two tables, one for "ACTIVE_CALLS" and one for "TERMINATED_CALLS". In this way the "ACTIVE_CALLS" table is always small and effective to access.<br>
D. Use DynamoDB with a "Calls" table and a Global Secondary Index on a "IsActive" attribute that is present for active calls only. In this way the Global Secondary Index is sparse and more effective.<br>

정답 : D
